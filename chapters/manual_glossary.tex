B | magnetic field

ballistic regime : $T_{aa}\~1$

c | speed of light : physical constant, $3*10^8 m/s$

channels | $N_{open}$ | $N_{closed}$ : 

conduction | conductivity | g :

dielectric constant | $\epsilon$ : physical property of a medium, $n=\sqrt{\epsilon}$

diffusion | diffusive regime : $u_{xx} D = u_{t}$

E | electric field 

energy : Energy = $\int |E|^2 dx$

flux

frequency | $\nu$

gain | g :

$\hat{\Gamma}_{ab}$ | scattering matrix

$\hbar$ : physical constant

I | Intensity : $I = |E|^2$

k | $\kappa$ : wave number. For closed channels, $k = i \kappa$

localized regime : absence of diffusion

$\ell_{scat}$ | scattering length : Ballistic regime only (not localized or diffusive regimes)

$\ell_{scat, ab}$ | scattering length in the presence of channels : localized or diffusive regimes only (not ballistic regime)

$\ell_{tmfp}$ | transport mean free path : localized or diffusive regimes only (not ballistic regime)

 | localization length : 

n | refractive index :  $n=\sqrt{\epsilon}$

point scatterers | delta-function scatterer : 0 dimensional defects that scatterer plane waves (and not ray tracing)

reflection | R | $R_{ab}$ | $r_{ab}$

S | scattering matrix

slab geometry : 1D, no diffusion. In physical 3D space, an infinite 2D plane with thickness L. Then light is incident perpendicular to the plan and sees a slab geometry.

spherical scatterer : finite sized (not a point) scatterer, for both plane waves and ray tracing

transmission | T | $T_{ab}$ | $t_{ab}$

transmittance

turbid

wavelength | $\lambda$
