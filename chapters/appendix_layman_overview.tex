The minimum to understand Anderson Localization is the concept of wave interference. 

useful mathematical concepts: linear algebra, calculus, partial differential equations

-Emergence: whole is different from the sum of its parts
   -diffusion, localization can not be seen from the perspective of inter-molecular interactions.

localization, diffusion are processes that arise from multiple events. What's the minimum number of events to constitute diffusion, localization?  
-how many people constitute a society? 
-how many atoms needed to demonstrate a phase change?

Answer: as many samples as are needed to get ensemble behavior, such that adding more samples does not affect the distribution.

This is an important question computationally, as you want to be able to claim universal behavior using ensemble averages, but you want to be doing the minimum number of samples required.  For example, 100,000 realizations to yield 0.000001 accuracy. Another example, $L=5 \lambda$
