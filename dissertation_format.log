Dear Dr Tauritz,

Prior to our meeting this morning I met with Dr Singler in the math department. He serves on the ITCC committee and the lack of dissertation template is now an item for discussion at the April ITCC meeting.

Would it be useful for your committee being formed to work with ITCC?

As I understand the situation, the concerned parties are
-Office of Graduate Studies, specifically Dr Allada, Vicki Hudgins, Roberta Cox, and Sharon Matson
-Library staff: Roger Weaver, Maggie Trish, possibly Becky Merrel
-ITCC?
-Graduate advisors who have individual templates: Dr Tauritz, Dr Homan,
-Graduate advisors who are interested in having a template: Dr Vojta, Dr Yamilov, Dr Parris, Dr Gosavi, Dr Jag, Dr Singler
-Graduate students. Possibly represented by Council of Graduate Students, i.e. Ben Payne

Is there anyone I'm missing?

I think it is probably important to distinguish the issues:
-establishing/changing the dissertation standard
-making a standard template available as an example; hosted by Office
of Graduate Studies (the "official" copy)
-moving towards electronic copies of the dissertation

While each of these ideas are useful, entangling them is not.

Ben

Hi Ben,

It's not clear to me why this is an appropriate issue for ITCC. The
number of stakeholders as you so eloquently list is getting awfully
large as it is, so adding additional parties that are not directly
involved seems like a bad idea. I suggest this item gets withdrawn from
the April ITCC agenda and instead I'll talk to Dr. Allada about
involving the stakeholders you list in the standard setting process.
Once the standard has been established, a standard LaTeX template should
indeed be posted on the OGS website.

As for moving towards electronic copies of theses and dissertations,
earlier today I sent a formal letter to Dr. Allada requesting OGS to
propose to the Graduate Faculty to add a digital only thesis archival
option. However, as you correctly point out, this is a separate issue
and should not be entangled with the issue of setting a new standard and
getting a corresponding LaTeX template posted.

Cheers,
Dr. T

Meeting with Goldman, Altynbek, and Dr Tauritz

Dr Tauritz has met with Dr Allada and Roberta Cox. Both of them want a new standard.

Dr Tauritz is interested in allowing electronic-only submission.

Dr Allada is interested in hiring someone to maintain the Latex sty file.
Dr Allada has asked Dr Tauritz to gather a committee to discuss this idea.

Dr Tauritz suggests we could present this standard to the committee. 

Dr Tauritz says not to post the template to the Office of Grad Studies site until he gives the go ahead.

Dr Tauritz will not be on campus during spring break.

Dr Tauritz does not agree with Goldman and Ben on the following:
Should the detailed rules determine the Latex style file, or should the Latex style file set the rules?
Dr Tauritz thinks the rules must be made explicit (do not just present the Latex style file as an example)

The dissertation consistency requirement is from the Graduate Faculty Council.

Vicki and Sharon would be happy to get rid of the publication option

notes from meeting with Roger Weaver 20120315
*********************************************

Roger Weaver at the library is willing to help OGS

For the library scanning to microfiche, there is no margin requirement. No requirement about limiting use of bold/italics. Font size doesn't matter. Library doesn't care about consistency (it is not mandatory).

Do use common fonts since Optical Character recognition is used on the scanned documents. Common fonts are the following: Courier, Helvitica, Times New Roman, and Arial.

Do produce a professional looking document. 

For printed bound copies destined for the library, use acid free and the OGS-determined paper weight.

Currently the scholar mine upload of PDFs is optional and printing/scanning is mandatory. Roger Weaver is advocating moving to PDF only and no bound copies. That change is not implemented yet.

Q: What is the use of latex versus MS Word at peer institutions?
Q: How many grad students would like to use Latex for their dissertations?
Q: How many advisors would like to use Latex for their dissertations?

Hello. For our meeting tomorrow Computer Science 213 at 10am on
Friday) and for everyone not coming, here is an update on the status
of the MS&T Latex template.


First, the people I've been talking to:

At the Office of Graduate Studies (OGS), my primary contacts are Vicki
Hudgins and Sharon Matson. I am planning on talking to Dr. Allada, but
have not met with him yet. [Dr. Newkirk is possibly also involved, but
he has not responded yet.]  Dr Allada and Dr Newkirk are the people to
meet with prior to presenting plans to the Graduate Faculty Council.

Professors who have worked on developing Latex .sty files, all
independent of one another, in no particular order:
-Dr Tauritz, Computer Science
-Dr Homan, Mechanical Engineering
-Dr Gosavi, Engineering Management
-Dr Vojta, Dr Yamilov; Physics
I am working on getting in contact with the following professors who
may have templates:
-Dr "Jag" Sarangapani, Elec. Comp. Engr. Out of office until April 1
-Dr Levent Acar, Elec. Comp. Engr. room 220
-Dr John Singler, Math room 312. Interested in having a template but doesn't have one

Another group of stakeholders is the library staff.  I have been
working with Roger Weaver (copyright issues), and will be meeting with
Becky Merrell (binding) on Friday.

All of the people I have met with so far have been extremely
supportive of the ideas which follow. For the purpose of presenting a
consistent plan, I would like to keep discussions on this list (rather
than each of us going individually to the people listed above). My
intention is to make the review process easier for future graduate
students by saving time while increasing consistency.

The two actions I am seeking are
(1) create/change the specifications of the thesis/dissertation for
increased consistency and then
(2) create templates demonstrating these standards and make the
templates available to graduate students.


For current thesis/dissertation guidelines, four templates (MS-report,
MS-publication, PhD-report, and PhD-publication) are needed

http://grad.mst.edu/media/administrative/grad/documents/thesis_guideline_7_09-.docx

http://grad.mst.edu/media/administrative/grad/documents/Dissertation_Guideline_7-09.doc

Both are linked from

http://grad.mst.edu/currentstudents/thesesdissertations/

The current guidelines are equally weighted, when in practice there
are varying degrees of importance. It would be extremely useful to
point out to graduate students which rules are necessary, and which
guidelines can be debated with OGS. I'll use the term "rule" to denote
a requirement, and "guideline" to indicate a flexible idea.

The rules are derived from the library process of scanning documents
to microfiche/microfilm and binding.
-pages must be numbered
-Table of Contents (ToC) must be consistent with content (i.e., page
numbers, section labels)


Then from the OGS, there are two primary guidelines:
-consistency within a single thesis/dissertation
-consistency across all theses/dissertations produced at MS&T

If the above ideas could be conveyed to graduate students, it would
make the process much more transparent and reduce frustration with
seemingly arbitrary rules.

All other (more specific) guidelines provided by OGS are arbitrary.
For example, the following specifications currently given by OGS

-right, top, and bottom margins must be greater than or equal to 1 inch
-left margin must be greater than or equal to 1.5 inches
-minimize use of bold and italics
-figure appears after first reference

are arbitrary and are not required by the library. There is a
reference book by Turabian, "A Manual for Writers" which is useful in
this process. I suggest in the MS&T guidelines defaulting all
guidelines to this source

****************************************

The following are specific change suggestions:

Currently, the Table of Contents (ToC) for the publication option is
structured as

SECTION
  1.  Introduction
       1.1   Asdf Jklm
       1.2   Qwer Uiop
PAPERS
  1.   Scientific Sounding Title goes here
       1.1 Introduction
       1.2 Blah Blah
  2.  Another Great Journal Article
       1.1  Introduction
       1.2  More Section
SECTION
  2.  Conclusions
        2.1  More Stuff Here
        2.2  Finally, the End


This structure has the problem that there are multiple "1.1" and
"1.2"; figures are numbered "1.1" and "1.2" in each paper. To correct
this, I propose the following ToC:

  1.  Introduction
       1.1   Asdf Jklm
       1.2   Qwer Uiop
  2.   Scientific Sounding Title goes here
       2.1 Introduction
       2.2 Blah Blah
  3.  Another Great Journal Article
       3.1  Introduction
       3.2  More Section
  4.  Conclusions
        4.1  More Stuff Here
        4.2  Finally, the End

This is what is currently used for "report" style. Then figures and
chapters are properly indexed. [Neither the 6th (1996) nor 7th edition
of Turabian's "A Manual for Writers" specifies the exact structure of the ToC.]

There are two issues with this proposed ToC. The "SECTION" and
"PAPERS" labels have been removed. Therefore, it makes sense to reduce
the number of templates from 4 to 2 (just MS and PhD, which would have
minimal
differences). Second, the intention of using a publication option is
to reduce the work of including previously published articles.
However, in the publishers I have reviewed (APS, IEEE, IOP) authors
cannot reproduce exact copies of the articles. Some rewrite is
necessary of the articles due to double spacing and the figure index.

To summarize, I advocate the following:
revise the Table of Contents, which results in a thesis/dissertation
which is basically similar for
publication and report styles. Therefore, just include a page at the
beginning explaining which chapters are published in which journals
[also required by publishers of the original articles].

***************************************

Independent of the changes suggested above, I have a few other
ease-of-formatting issues.

The guidelines from OGS say the figure must occur after it is first
referenced (and not before). This is not the method used in
peer-reviewed journal articles, and when using Latex the decision of
figure placement is not made by the author. Turabian says
"Illustrations, ..., should be placed as close as possible to their
first references in the text." (6th edition, page 105). Similar idea
on page 370 of 7th edition.

For figures which take up a full page, I advocate not requiring the
figure to be at the top of the page and below the 1" margin.

For figure indices in the publication option, I advocate using the
same method as the report option. In the current publication ToC this
is not applicable.

*************************************

What remains to be done:

Find all professors on campus who have developed a .sty, get them
together on this idea.

Implement a dissertation which exhibits all the features I am
proposing. Since my dissertation must be submitted April 4, I am
planning on having it ready by then.

Once a satisfactory template exists, I will be giving the OGS a .sty
and .pdf template for MS and PhDs. Vicki and Sharon said today
(20120315) that they would be happy to post this to their OGS website,
even though neither will support Latex development.
